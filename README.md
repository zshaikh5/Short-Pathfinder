# Short_Pathfinder
The Greedy Robot Path Finder is a C++ program that finds all unique shortest paths for a robot to travel from a starting position to a treasure in a grid. The robot can move in four directions: North, South, East, and West. The program uses a recursive depth-first search approach to explore all possible paths and outputs the number of unique paths along with the paths themselves.
